Great cam for first DSLR folks.The disappointment is only with the Courier service, have been very pathetic service with Amazon delivery and it's been so worst since a couple of months recently. Amazon should rethink of the Courier partner. Will be a big drawback with this worst way of the delivery service .\n",

      "   The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices..  Canon1500D has a  superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D  Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing  ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus.  Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .Here are a few of my shots clicked using this camera.\n",

      "   This is my first camera and I'm extremely happy with my choice. It is just the right DSLR for a beginner. The displayed instruction for every function helps you to navigate yourself through them. Within a day or two you will know everything about it. It has a really fast auto focus and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. Being a beginner, I feel that I couldn't have chosen a better one.\n",

      "   I am using this for couple of months. In this model Canon has removed the center pin in Hot Shoe. Hence most of cheaper after market external Speedlight flashes cannot be used in this DSLR model. Very few models can be used which are TTL capable - but those are above 4K INR. So anyone looking to buy this please be prepared to invest in costly Canon or third party Speedlight Flashes. Inbuilt Flash is of no use.\n",

      "   For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.\n",

      "   This is hands down, best entry level camera for regular use.  Begin with auto mode (auto focus, auto flash everything auto). Explore and learn slowly on your own or by watching some videos on youtube, and become an expert in no time. Once you become professional, you can be the photographer at your own wedding. All the best\n",

      "   M writing this review after usage of 1.5 years of canon1500D:-The camera is good - only for new comers into photography.. If you’re a photographer who does paid shoot or is interested in various amounts of genre in photography then I suggest to go with a lil high budget of another camera. This camera is good only with 50MM lens.. if you click pictures with the 18-55 MM lens then you are gonna definitely face issues with Noise in the picture.. same if you use 55-250 there is a high chance if getting shaken images also adding noise into it..if u have budget issues and are very good with post processing skills then you can go for it or else not..Overall:-Picture Quality:- 3Auto Focus:- 4Battery life:- 5\n",

      "   Honest Review: this canon camera is not good for beginners,, better to go for good point and shoot camera or good quality mobile bcoz when you shoot your video this will not give you any auto focus to moving object. So this will just give auto focus to a particular object only and when your object go front and back.. this get automatically blurred in case of video. This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only. We shoot video for moving things.. so worst buy. 1500d is totally worst for video.\n",

Product was Packed Tight Perfectly in Sealed condition.Box contains: Camera Body, 18-55 Lens, Strap, Battery, Battery Charging Adapter & Wire, Kingston 16GB Memory Card, A Carry Case, Warranty Card and Guide.Turned it On After mounting the Lens to the body and started to Click Pictures and I must Say The Quality of the Pictures are Damn Great and Amazing. Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoWI have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price.\n",

      "   Please see the unboxing photos as attached along with this review. Carefully check before placing orders what you are going to get. Memory card will not be part of this. I found camera bag missing. Also SD card slot does not have the tray/container to insert a SD card, even though you buy a SD card on your own separately. Also see the picture carefully, without lens the camera will look like as shown in the picture. I wanted to capture all accessories included when I got it delivered. Conclusion: amazon FBA is not justifying with customers. Canon original product definitely has all accessories even including SD card I believe. Now I doubt about the quality of packing and condition of the camera, never know it's just an used product got delivered. Moreover, the product does not have refund policy. Be very careful before placing an order.\n",

      "   We have received the defective piece and it was not getting charged.... Even there is no return for it.. just a replacement on which  we dont have any trust how it would be... and more over they have shown a deal of 3000 rs less now and i want it for newer price as product was defective and want a newer one..for which the amazon customer care said that he cannot do anything...\n",

      "   DO NOT BUYCanon has tried to create monopoly through this model. Hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will  work with this model i.e. Canon eos 1500d.They have NOT even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website, not even the dealers of canon know this new development.The LCD screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models.\n",

      "   Some people believe that online shopping is not safe for digital items .but it's not true .I have been buying products from Amazon for 3 years. I didn't receive any of the item as damaged.It was a very big decision of mine to buy an item of heavy amount through online shopping, I was thinking that it would come damaged or broken but after receiving it I will say that it is best for normal people who use to click photos everywhere they travel as Nikon is good for the photographers .I will recommend the viewers of the product to surely buy this .👍\n",

      "   Best for beginners and if you are buying this for vlogging purposes i will not recommend it because it is very hard to handle without a gimbal or tripod.Picture quality is superb and video quality is good.Battery capacity is very good comparing to other models of canon.Auto focus is fine and inbuilt flash is superb.Wifi and nfc are Woking fast and no lag at all.I recommend this for professional videographers and YouTubers the most.\n",

      "   Nikon 3400 is better than 3500 so don't buy nikon 3500.But i choose canon 1500 because wifi , camera app, You definitely need extra lens. 50mm is good because i though kit lens is ok for me but believe me  you definitely need extra lens. Zoom lens is not you need so don't buy with combo lens. Go for 50 mm lens. Now one more thing\n",

      "   Good camera, but no external mic port.. if you want a camera with external voice recorder please select some other one. Without knowing this I had purchased this, even the same day return also not possible with Amazon. But camera is awesome, try to purchase with combo lense otherwise lense cost will be more.\n",

So far, good to practice your skills on, but definitely would suggest to move on to other better options quickly.It comes with a kit lense and a kit bag to hold the camera body, lense and batterycharger, but the holding loop of the bag got torn off on the second day !!!... That was a bit dissapointing.\n",

      "   This is a very suitable, easy to handle DSLR camera for people who want to start out with digital photography. I was able to operate this camera very easily after learning different functionalities by watching several videos online. Strongly recommended for people with no or very little exposure to DSLR. One can always choose to buy a better lens later if they feel like upgrading the quality of the pictures.\n",

I belive anyone who knows basic rules of photography should buy this, you will have an amazing time with this camera, the canon mobile app also helps with the remote capture. Autofocus could have been better for subject which are really close but never the less its the best entry level camera in the world\n",

But normal photography is average equivalent to good quality images of photo captured from most of the mobile phone except pixels.Clearity is good which can't be available in most of the image captured from mobile ..there is no in built image effect. So image u will get will be original.So it can be tried. But if u have budget,I will guggest better to go for higher version .\n",
